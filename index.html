            <h2>Resume<h2>
              <p>Previous to joining Code Fellows, I spent several years working in PR and marketing. Most recently, I served as the Communications Manager at the Ronald McDonald House of Western Washington and Alaska. After working mostly for nonprofit organizations, I also worked briefly promoting SQL Server and other Microsoft big data products with a job at Waggener Edstrom in 2015, which made me realize how much I love tech! </p>

              <p>English major, meet technical talk. Thanks to Code Fellows, I grok dev-speak, but I can easily translate complex technical issues for those who don't. In addition to HTML, CSS, Javascript, and basic SQL, I has working knowledge of several languages, including:</p>

                <li>English - fluent, native speaker</li>
                <li>French - 5 years academic study, 4 years living in Montreal</li>

              <h4>Volunteering</h4>
              <p>Michelle is passionate about making a difference in the community around her, as evidenced by her strong passion for nonprofit work and steady stream of volunteer work! Most recently, she helped with the Tech Crunch Pitch Off competition in Seattle. She volunteers regularly as an usher with many theaters in town. Additionally, she has donated hundreds of hours of time in PR and marketing services to the Metropolitan Opera National Council Northwest and the Fisher Ensemble, a modern opera company. When she has the time, she also enjoys volunteering as "minion" at Emerald City Comicon.</p>
